**This week**, someone else's hands were doing the cooking, so I could and did remember to take photographs. Credit due Fiona for this one; we don't know where the recipe originated. Lateness due to difficulties in actually retrieving said photographs.

*Pork Fillet with Figs and Tallegio - Serves three. Two if you're hungry. Four if you're small.*

*Ingredients*

 - One whole pork fillet
 - 6-8 dried figs
 - ~125ml dry sherry
 - 150g Tallegio D.O.P [^n]
 - A dozen or so sprigs fresh rosemary
 - Salt
 - Pepper
 - Courgettes
 - Butter
 - Red wild rice
 - Cream

*Method*

To start off, you want to get the figs drunk. They're parched, it's only kind. Sit them in a bowl, covered with the sherry, for at least an hour or so before you start doing anything else.

Take your pork fillet, and lay it on a wooden or plastic board (not glass, unless you like eating glass shards), with clingfilm between it and the board. Slit it down the centre about 3/4 of the way through, lay it out flat, then cover with clingfilm and beat it with a meat mallet until about 8-10mm thick and fully tenderised.

Dice your tallegio into ~12mm blocks. Discard the orange skin, it's not especially tasty.

Extract your figs from the sherry and remove their stalks. This should open up a handy cavity, into each of which you need to press a block of tallegio. Lay your stuffed figs in a line down the long axis of the flattened pork, tight against each other. Do remember to remove the clingfilm, it melts and smokes in the oven and doesn't add much to the flavour. Dash of salt and a fair bit of pepper, then roll the pork around the figs and tie it up with string.

In an ovenproof dish, lay all the rosemary sprigs in a line, then place the pork on top of them. Pour the sherry which the figs were soaking in over the pork, then send the whole lot into the oven at 453K.

You'll have quite a bit of tallegio left over. That goes into a saucepan, along with about 30g of butter and 3tbsp of cream, plus liberal pepper and a little salt. Low heat, melt and stir until homogeneous liquid is obtained.

Rice goes in a pan, covered, with water. About eighteen minutes should do it. Courgettes can either be steamed, as here, or fried in butter. Either way they take moments.

Once the meat is done, pull from the oven and allow to rest while you give each plate a portion of rice and courgettes. Slice thickly, distribute, and pour the dairy over.

Nom.

[^n]: This is a soft, moderately strong-smelling cheese. Substitute accordingly if necessary. If you like blue cheese, Stilton might work well.
