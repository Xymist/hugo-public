**I felt like** building something less samey than another test website or to-do list app, so I'm working on a text-based adventure. As they say, the two hardest things in computer science are naming things and cache invalidation; consequently this little app labours under the uninspired name of ["Sloggit"](/project/sloggit), until I can think of a better one.

For the moment there are no caches involved, thankfully, but I am running into the less formally-hard problem of story writing. It's all very well creating an environment and a map and so on, but an inability to create a compelling storyline does somewhat scupper the chances of any game getting beyond a very basic level. Quite aside from anything else, playtesting has to not be tedious, which is a serious problem for a game with zero apparent plot.

This may be on hold now that I've learned some of the things I wanted to learn from it, just because of that.
