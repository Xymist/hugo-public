**I felt like** building something less samey than another test website or to-do list app, so I'm working on a text-based adventure. As they say, the two hardest things in computer science are naming things and cache invalidation; consequently this little app labours under the uninspired name of ["Sloggit"](/project/sloggit), until I can think of a better one.

For the moment there are no caches involved, thankfully.
