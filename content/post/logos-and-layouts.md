**I'm not** extensively trained in design principles; I should be, and will be addressing that deficiency at some point in the next year, but currently that sort of thing is all a bit hit and miss.

I approached a friend[^1], who principally works in WordPress but has some additional experience in this area; he gave me some pointers on reducing the 'blank' nature of the main site as a starting point. The background image[^2]  I've cropped and edited slightly to use as the banner here.

The main site now has a page with a contact form; this is stage one of something I feel quite necessary. This contact form, through the magic of JS[^3], will (eventually) encrypt anything put in it with my public key, and send it directly to my email address. This should make securely contacting me trivial, even for those people for whom setting up Enigmail would be a challenge too far. For now it's just a contact form; I'm still configuring OpenPGPJS.

Responsiveness has improved dramatically; in fact, today is the first time I'd say it works (approximately) as intended on mobile.
