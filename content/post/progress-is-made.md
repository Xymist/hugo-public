It doesn't *look* like much, but the main site is now nicely configured, and the root URL redirects where it's supposed to... unfortunately not transparently. Still working on that; apparently .htaccess configurations don't play nice with ngRoute.

I've also set up [MathJax](http://mathjax.org) and [Prism](http://prismjs.com), so when I want to show off crappy code and inaccurate maths, they'll look less crappy and inaccurate.

This is a learning experience, like anything else. These posts rapidly become out of date; hopefully in a few months I can, as ever, look back and laugh at how 'stupid' I was such a short time ago. @Future!Jamie: Please confirm or deny?

Working in AngularJS is proving tricky for all sorts of reasons, but it feels a lot less 'magical' than working in Rails. With the latter, a small amount of very neat and readable Ruby code is leveraged into a working site, but without fine-grained control or obvious mechanism being necessary. Javascript is less forgiving, but much more configurable. I'm sure once I understand, rather than simply 'understanding' enough to make it work, there will be many more places to go.

I held off on learning JS for a long time, preferring the friendliness of Python and Ruby. I may live to regret that delay, but so far, upskilling is proving fun.

Level Up - one skill point.

*Future!Jamie here: This does indeed look a bit ridiculous from this end of the year. Moreover it's hopelessly out of date, since I no longer use Angular, Prism or Apache2 for the website...*
