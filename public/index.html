    I felt like building something less samey than another test website or to-do list app, so I&rsquo;m working on a text-based adventure. As they say, the two hardest things in computer science are naming things and cache invalidation; consequently this little app labours under the uninspired name of &ldquo;Sloggit&rdquo;, until I can think of a better one. For the moment there are no caches involved, thankfully.

    Following my successful move to new hosting, there&rsquo;s been a bit of a hiatus in my blogging. This has mainly come about because I&rsquo;ve been doing some actual useful work, at least some of which has involved some coding, which is always entertaining. I&rsquo;ve been in need of a good low-level (ish) language for some time - my D is poor, my C/C++ nonexistent, and my Java not exactly stellar. The biggest problem has been finding one which I like, and which compares favourably in terms of readability to Ruby, which has been my favourite language (slightly ahead of Python) for quite some time.

    I&rsquo;ve been meaning for a while to move over from shared hosting to a VPS, partly for control and partly because it seemed like the sort of thing I should know how to do. Along the way, I managed to: Install Nginx (web server, for pointing people to this blog and my main site) Set up Git to allow me to version control and deploy my various sites Acquire an SSL Certificate so that I can force using HTTPS Install and configure Postfix and Dovecot so that my email addresses work.

    I promised quite a long time ago, now, to give you all the rest of my recipe for not-actually-cassoulet. The confit duck legs of the previous recipe are one component of this; today you get the rest. Lucky you! I suggest you do the legs first since they need several days to mature. The topping on this variant happens to be gluten-free, which was originally just because a friend of mine has this habit of getting rather ill when she eats bread, but turned out to be a rather tasty alternative to breadcrumbs.

    This one was actually done on a Sunday, but you&rsquo;re getting it on Wednesday because how else does one maintain a new tradition? Confit duck leg isn&rsquo;t exactly complex, though there&rsquo;s a fair bit in the sauce here, but it&rsquo;s delicious and sounds impressive, if that&rsquo;s something you go for in your food. Duck itself is a fairly versatile meat, so long as you don&rsquo;t overwhelm the flavour. In this instance it&rsquo;s paired with orange, which is classic, but there are an awful lot of options.

    The strange thing about this film is that it&rsquo;s worth watching repeatedly. That&rsquo;s usually just the mark of a good film, but given the premise involves a man repeating a single day of his life for what appears to be several subjective decades (or perhaps centuries), there&rsquo;s a certain sense of the appropriate in its revisitability. On this watching, I was struck by something that I&rsquo;d somehow missed the implications of before.

    It&rsquo;s very rare for me to encounter a book which affects me enough that I have to put it down every few pages, think about it, and take notes. This is one of those rare ones. It&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone, but if you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration and for encouragement in being more effective, you&rsquo;ll start getting your fix about half a chapter in - and it doesn&rsquo;t let up. Marshall sets out his ambition to become &lsquo;the finest strategist of a generation&rsquo;, and then goes on to reveal how, precisely, he believes it will be possible for him to achieve this.

    If you&rsquo;re considering teaching yourself to code, or even just to code in a new language, I heartily recommend you take a look at Project Euler. It&rsquo;s essentially a collection of user-submitted maths questions, sufficiently tricky as to require solving by a computer, but sufficiently unintensive that programs capable of solving them can run in a reasonable time. The mathematics themselves are done by your code, but the real challenge lies in thinking through the necessary algorithms and program flow such that you can build something which fulfils the requirements.
