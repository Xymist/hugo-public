      <title>Kiosk Logging System</title>
      <link>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/kiosk-logger/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/kiosk-logger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Xymist/caw-kiosk-logger&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-github fa-3x&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a utility for creating a coherent log of kiosk access by public users. This retrieves data from the Firefox history and activity databases, interprets them, and feeds them to a central server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written in Ruby (and a tiny bit of Bash scripting), this runs as a service watching the relevant databases, reads, formats and loads the data into a logfile. It then sends this upstream once each day. While doing this, it also sends a heartbeat signal every five minutes, giving early warning of connection failures and inactive kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Xymist/caw-kiosk-logsite&#34;&gt;companion site&lt;/a&gt; for the data logger, which receives uploads from the various kiosks, parses them into a SQLite database and generates reports for end users on the operation of the terminals. This is being written in Ruby on Rails, which is probably slight overkill for the task at hand but happens to include useful packages like ActiveRecord, which are preferable to rolling my own database connections and other such necessaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes the raw data from the uploaded log files, loads them into a Postgres database, and manipulates them in a variety of ways to display the necessary information to non-technical end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I known in advance that I was going to need these functions, the kiosk site itself (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/citizens-advice-kiosks/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for that project) would have looked very different. I would almost certainly have done the entire thing in Ruby on Rails, logged every click server side, had each of the kiosks as users on a single site rather than doing a separate site for each (that last one was not my decision, I hasten to add; I protested the unmaintainability of that model from the start, but was overruled because &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s the way we&amp;rsquo;ve always done it&amp;rdquo;) and had the backend data viewable just as an admin panel on that site, saving everyone time, energy and server resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a chance that this pilot project will be expanded to several times its current size. If that happens, I will lobby hard to be allowed to kill the multiple front ends and expand the log companion site to include the front end pages, removing the need for the logscript part of this project entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waverley Advice Website</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the banner of &amp;lsquo;Get Advice In Waverley&amp;rsquo; this project aimed to enable the delivery of &amp;lsquo;joined-up advice&amp;rsquo; across Waverley, with information available to the general public and an inter-organisation referral system behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citizens&#39; Advice Kiosk Project</title>
      <link>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/citizens-advice-kiosks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/citizens-advice-kiosks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project, led by Citizens&amp;rsquo; Advice Waverley as part of the Lottery-funded Advice Services Transformation Programme, was intended to support people within the community by providing information and advice in a self-served manner. It has been observed that a proportion of the people attending GP surgeries do not do so principally due to mental or physical infirmity, but due to issues elsewhere in their life which may or may not have a medical effect or solution. Debt problems, marital concerns and other such non-medical problems are best addressed by advice, information, and referral to the correct legal bodies where necessary. The GPs in question are, naturally, unable to help beyond issuing antidepressants; this represents a cost to the NHS and to the community which could be greatly reduced by giving these &amp;lsquo;patients&amp;rsquo; the information they need to address the underlying cause of their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end a number of touchscreen kiosks, giving access to curated webpages of various public and third-sector bodies, were installed in the waiting rooms of charities and GPs surgeries across Surrey. I wrote and reviewed responses for a request for tender, via which the hardware for this was procured externally; rather than look externally for software, I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Xymist/waverley-terminal-deployed&#34;&gt;the interface&lt;/a&gt; intended to run on them (essentially just a webpage presenting groups of curated links in obvious categories) myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior information was available from a similar project run by Citizens&amp;rsquo; Advice Guildford; the principal difference was that this earlier project had involved using human outreach workers in public places at specified times, rather than technology available at any time. This allowed them to collect some data which are unavailable with the less personal approach (each person interviewed as part of that project was given a questionnaire to complete after being provided with advice) but with only three hours of experimental time per week per site their longitudinal data were patchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after the end of this project, it became clear that a new bid was being prepared which would benefit greatly from access to the information from these kiosks regarding usage rates, access times, popularity of categories of information and so on. Therefore I was contracted to produce further software for retrieving, organising and presenting these data as requested by the new bid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Citizens&#39; Advice VoIP Conversion</title>
      <link>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/citizens-advice-voip/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/citizens-advice-voip/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was working with Citizens Advice Waverley on their Advice Services Transformation Programme, it became clear that their use of telephony and internet was enormous compared to many business, including as it does negotiation and advice sessions over hours on the telephone. I requested the relevant invoices from the finance department, and set about investigating how much money they could &amp;lsquo;save&amp;rsquo; by switching over to a Voice over IP system, whereby all communications of any kind would go over the internet. As a first pass estimate I came up with a figure of 30%, which was sufficient to convince others within CAW management to approve a more detailed appraisal of the options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of that decision I was made responsible for investigating forms of VoIP, the cost efficiency of each given the size of Citizens Advice Waverley (20 paid staff, 160 volunteers), and the potential suppliers. I interviewed staff at all levels to gain a clear picture of the requirements, frustration points with the existing system, and a &amp;lsquo;wish list&amp;rsquo; for the new system. I then wrote the specification, drafted the tender documents and acted as primary evaluator on the returned tenders. I oversaw the development and installation of the finished system, working closely with both the sales and technical team of the supplier, and created the requirements for the configuration. As part of this all offices were moved to fibre broadband, increasing the speed and stability of the connection to the countrywide databases upon which much of the organisation&amp;rsquo;s work depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the system was in place, I acted as trainer for the management staff who needed to be able to alter the configuration, and for the volunteers. I conducted training and coaching both one-to-one and en masse in the use of the new handsets and the new features available in the system, ensuring all staff were capable of using the system to its fullest potential. Once this system was in, there were training issues surrounding adding new handsets and so on; to simplify the process of forcing new handsets to update their software (since the administrative staff were not happy with a command line based approach) I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Xymist/phone-update-script&#34;&gt;a script&lt;/a&gt; to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further to this, I have been pushing for the ability to use the system as a revenue stream for the organisation, by providing low-cost telephony to other charities and to businesses within the area using the new PBXs. Negotiations are currently ongoing, but there are several potential &amp;lsquo;tenants&amp;rsquo; interested in the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall savings to the organisation were on the order of 20% of the previous annual communications costs for the first five years; at my urging a sinking fund was established to allow them to renew the maintenance contract at the end of that period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Haslemere Cellar Web Presence</title>
      <link>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/haslemere-cellar/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jamieduerden.co.uk/project/haslemere-cellar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was for a retail client, using the Sellerdeck Ecommerce and EPOS system. It was intended to give the Haslemere Cellar a web presence, and expand their ability to communicate with their customers. To this end I constructed a website, product database, Facebook page, Twitter feed and Constant Contact mailing list, integrating these together for ease of use and updating by the business owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that he has chosen to barely maintain the result is disquieting, but understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
