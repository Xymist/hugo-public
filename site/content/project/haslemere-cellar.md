This project was for a retail client, using the Sellerdeck Ecommerce and EPOS system. It was intended to give the Haslemere Cellar a web presence, and expand their ability to communicate with their customers. To this end I constructed a website, product database, Facebook page, Twitter feed and Constant Contact mailing list, integrating these together for ease of use and updating by the business owner.

The fact that he has chosen to barely maintain the result is disquieting, but understandable.
