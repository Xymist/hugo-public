Not exactly original, as titles go, but hey, if the hat fits...

That you made it here shows a scintilla of imagination, given that it's not linked from the main site. That or you're very curious and randomly enter things into your address bar.

The main portion of this site is an experiment in *AngularJS*, about which I know the square root of sod all, and principally exists because I needed something to practice on. At time of writing it's still buggy; hopefully by the time anyone reads this it will be slick, shiny, and a demonstration of what can be done if one is bored enough.

This portion is more about documentation; things I've been working on, bits of fiction, photographs, ideas. There probably won't be much about my life, but if I create or learn anything fun, it'll end up here.

Until next time,

Jamie
