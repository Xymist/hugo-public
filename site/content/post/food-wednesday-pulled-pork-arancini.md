This is one of those recipes where I can sort of see how it came into being, but it's a long way from its starting points. The rice preparation is sushi base, the pulled pork goes well in sandwiches, arancini are Italian. Culturally horrifying? Sure. So sue me, it tastes great. Anyone not convinced about bacon, halloumi, mango and black pepper, just try it - it's a great salad all by itself.

This one happens to be gluten free, but if you want to sub out the cornflakes for breadcrumbs or panko, it'll work just fine. I suppose you could also batter them, if you wanted something more portable.

*Pulled Pork Arancini (sort of [^1]) - Serves 6*

*Ingredients*

For the arancini:
800g boned pork shoulder
100g diced fennel
1 chopped celery stick
300g sushi or risotto rice[^2]
2 tbsp mirin
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar
4 tbsp liquid honey
Handful of cloves
Water
1 tsp monosodium glutamate
Salt
Pepper
Several handfuls of crushed cornflakes

For the sauce:
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
100g brown sugar
250ml draught Guinness
70g tomato pur√©e
1 finely-diced chilli[^3]

To serve:
6 rashers back bacon
1 ripe mango
300g halloumi in 8mm slices

*Method*

Place the pork shoulder in a small casserole. Add the honey, the fennel, the celery and the cloves, then top up with water to just below the top of the pork. With the lid on, cook for four hours at ~450K, turning over around every 45 minutes.

Around an hour before the pork is due to finish, set your rice to simmer, covered, under its own volume of water. In a separate saucepan, mix the mirin, rice vinegar, caster sugar, MSG and 2tsp salt. Simmer and stir until everything has dissolved, then leave to cool to room temperature.

Once the rice has absorbed all the water, add the mirin mixture and stir it through. Abandon this lot for now, it needs to cool down.

You should have some very tender pork by this point, so pull it out of the oven and onto a board. No rush, let it rest for a few minutes. The pan that had the mirin in it is now empty, so the remaining honey and water (there shouldn't be much) goes in there, through a sieve to catch the solids. You don't need the plant bits, chuck 'em. Follow that with the rest of the sauce ingredients, plus a good measure of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then turn down so it's simmering. Don't cover, this needs to reduce a long way. You'll know it's done when it behaves like honey.

Grab yourself a couple of forks, and shred that pork. Should be an easy job if you left it in the oven long enough. Keep pulling it apart, working along the grain, until it's all ribbons. The sauce won't be done yet, but rescue a tablespoon of it and mix up that, the shredded pork, and the rice into one sticky mass. Divide this into six (or however many you feel like, really; just beware that too small and they'll be nasty and hard, too big and they won't fry properly). Put them on a tray and leave to set.

Start heating up your deep fryer, and throw your bacon in a large frying pan with the halloumi and some paprika. Roll each of the pork balls in the crushed cornflakes, then once the oil is very hot deep fry them until golden brown.

Plate: Chopped bacon, halloumi, a slice of the mango, and a good spoonful of the reduction. Liberal grind of black pepper over the mango.
