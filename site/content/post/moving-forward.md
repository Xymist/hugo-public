**Disappointingly, my favourite** Italian deli closed down a couple of weeks ago. It's a small thing, for me - I can no longer chat to Massimo, the owner, or indulge in his delicious heavily spiced meatball panini, but overall my life hasn't really changed - but as time goes by I'm coming to realise that the small things can be remarkably important. 

It's my birthday today. I'm twenty-five years old. That's an important thing, so they tell me. 

Somehow, I have acquired employment. Actual doing-things-so-someone-pays-me-regularly employment rather than the halfway states of freelancing and contract work which have previously occupied my time. This is a bit of a departure for me, not least because I have an uneasy relationship with the concept of working for anyone other than myself, but it is a remote position and I appear to have a fair bit of leeway in how I structure my work as long as I produce the results requested.

Other than a slightly ridiculous requirement that basically all information is kept as a `.docx` or `.xlsx` 'somewhere' in the (vast, semistructured) Google Drive storage, anyway. Apparently that's so the people who don't use GitHub and can't read Markdown get a look in, which seems like a very bad plan from start to finish, frankly, but it's not my company so I can't say much. Did I mention uneasiness with working for other people?
