**Or** something. The main site needed a logo, so I generated a sort of agglomeration of my three initials. My artistic skills with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) aren't up to much, but it looks sort of the same as I sketched it:

Still some work to do; it doesn't feel quite right, but it's unique and I made it, which is always a nice set of things to be able to say about something.
