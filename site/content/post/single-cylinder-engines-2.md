**This weekend**, I thought it would be sensible to attempt to finish what I'd started with the broken petrol engine.

Having thoroughly de-greased and cleaned all the components, then rinsed them in WD-40 and left to dry for a week, I was hoping to see some improvement.

Reassembly went reasonably well.

It does turn over a great deal more easily; the sound of well-oiled machinery rather than grinding metal. However...

It doesn't work. I suppose that would have been too much to hope for a first try. So far, I've determined that the spark plug works and has a suitable gap (compared with a spare), that the fuel line and air intake are free of debris, and that all components are where they need to be. Fuel placed in the 'cup' of the fuel intake is taken in, but not ignited.

I'm a little puzzled, so it's back to research for now.

Addendum 14/08/15: After some research and further examining the parts, it looks like all the gaskets and seals need replacing. This engine isn't made any more, and spare parts seem few and far between, so I am unlikely to be able to fix it. Especially as it didn't work before I started.

I've learned a great deal, though, so I consider this a partial success despite the fact that the engine will now *definitely* never run again, rather than just *probably*.
